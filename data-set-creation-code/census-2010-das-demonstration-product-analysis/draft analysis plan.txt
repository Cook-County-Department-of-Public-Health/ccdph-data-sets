Calculate metrics for the following geographies

1) census tract total 
2) census tract Hispanic 
3) census tract non-Hispanic Black 
4) census tract non-Hispanic Asian
5) census block group total 
6) muni total 
7) muni Hispanic 
8) muni non-Hispanic Black
9) muni non-Hispanic Asian
10) muni standard census age groups* (no demonstration data currently available)

Calculate following metrics

1) Absolute change in number for each geography
2) Mean absolute change for all - how big and is there any directionality
3) Absolute percent change for each geography; flag outliers above 5% - produce scatter plots and consider mapping outliers to see if they are spatially clustered
4) Mean percent change for all - how big and is there any directionality
